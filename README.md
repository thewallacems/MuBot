# MuBot
MuBot was a Discord Bot that I used to scrape the rankings page of the MapleStory private server MapleUnity. It also provided functionality for scraping the library of items, mobs, maps, etc. for data for quick search-up through Discord. This bot is currently disabled due to the closing of MapleUnity in October of 2018.

This bot worked by parallel scraping multiple pages of the rankings on the MapleUnity website and collecting each character's class and level to provide an accurate statistic of what amount of each class and job branch was played to evaluate their popularity to find trends and to find balance disparities in each class better.
